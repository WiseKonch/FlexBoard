# FlexBoard
Here, we present FlexBoard template and its drafting.


## What is FlexBoard?
FlexBoard is Flexible breadboarding platform that has upward/downward bending capability and plugging spots like breadboard.
FlexBoard enables rapid prototyping with interactive components such as sensors, actuators and displays on curved and deformable objects. 


## Design of FlexBoard
FlexBoard is designed from a flexible living hinge. The hinges tightly hold the metal strips of conventional breadboard while keeping flexibility.
FlexBoard can be either cut into specific length or joined with other hinges through ball joint systems.


## Fabrication of FlexBoard
Users can refer our drafting and customize it to their own purposes.
Of course, they can directly download stl files(we provide 3 hinge units and 72 hinge) and play with it.


### How to make FlexBoard?
**3D printing**

FlexBoard can be printed with common FDM 3D printer.
Our hinge design is designed for nylon filament(FYI, we used 245 \degree C nozzle temperature & 70 \degree C bed temperature). PLA filament is a bit stiff and hardly afford repeatitive bending.
We recommend to print less than 0.3mm nozzle size and set the layer height to 0.15mm in the slicer to preserve the details of the living hinge pattern.

**Extracting Terminal Strips**

Users can extract metal strip from existing breadboard. 
We recommend to peel off the tape from the backside of the breadboards, which released most of the terminal strips from the board.
To extract the remaining strips, we either used our own tape, placed it across the backside of the breadboard, and peeled it off to release more of the terminal strips or used a needle to push the remaining strips out.
